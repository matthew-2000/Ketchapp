# Ketchapp - Pomodoro Study Time Manager 🍅

Ketchapp is an iOS app developed in UIKit, following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. This project was developed in collaboration with Apple as part of the Apple Foundation Program 👨🏻‍💻🍏 at the University of Salerno.

## Overview

Ketchapp is a productivity app designed to help students optimize their study time using the Pomodoro Technique 🥫. It provides a streamlined way to create, organize, edit, and delete tasks, making it easier than ever to manage study sessions effectively.

## Features

- **Task Management 📱:** Create, organize, edit, and delete tasks with ease. Each task can be customized according to your preferences.

- **Pomodoro Session 🍅:** Ketchapp follows the rules of the Pomodoro Technique. You can set the duration of each task to be either twenty, twenty-five, or thirty minutes, and customize break times to three, four, or five minutes.

- **Automatic Timer Control ⏱️:** To ensure maximum focus during study sessions, Ketchapp requires you to place your phone on a flat surface to start an activity. If you pick up your phone during a session, the app will automatically pause the timer and prompt you to put down the device. Once you comply, the timer will restart.

- **Scheduled Breaks ⌛️:** After completing four tasks, Ketchapp provides a longer break that corresponds to the length of one full Pomodoro session.

- **Freedom During Breaks 🎮:** During breaks, you're free to do whatever you like. Ketchapp will notify you when the break is over, ensuring you're ready for the next study session.

- **Task Completion 🎉:** When all tasks within an activity are completed, Ketchapp will automatically delete them and congratulate you for your efforts.
